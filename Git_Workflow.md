## Start using the repo *git clone https://github.com/ValRCS/RCS_Python.git*
* clones whole repo in the current working directory from which you run git clone

## Update automagically: *git pull* 
* pulls changes from default origin(this repo) into your local repo and merges them
* if you are not making extensive changes this is easiest

## Update manually: *git fetch*  then *git merge*
