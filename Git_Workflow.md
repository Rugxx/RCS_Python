## Start using the repo *git clone https://github.com/ValRCS/RCS_Python.git*
* clones whole repo in the current working directory from which you run git clone

## Update your local repo once you have it: *git fetch* run from the same directory that you run *git clone*


### Update automagically original repo: *git pull* 
* pulls changes from default origin(this repo) into your local repo and merges them into original repo
* This would require a pull request if you are not the owner of the repo
