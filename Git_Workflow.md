## Start using the repo run in terminal: 
*git clone https://github.com/ValRCS/RCS_Python.git*
* clones whole repo in the current working directory from which you run git clone

## Update automagically original repo: *git pull* from the same directory
* git pull is like two commands into one
* git fetch + git merge pulls changes from default origin(this repo) into your local repo and merges them
